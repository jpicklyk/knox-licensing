# If this option is given, pppd will send an LCP echo-request frame to the
# peer every n seconds. Normally the peer should respond to the echo-request
# by sending an echo-reply. This option can be used with the
# lcp-echo-failure option to detect that the peer is no longer connected.
lcp-echo-interval 3

# If this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be dead if n
# LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply.
# If this happens, pppd will terminate the connection.  Use of this
# option requires a non-zero value for the lcp-echo-interval parameter.
# This option can be used to enable pppd to terminate after the physical
# connection has been broken (e.g., the modem has hung up) in
# situations where no hardware modem control lines are available.
lcp-echo-failure 2

# Set the LCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to <n> seconds
# (default 3).

# Set the maximum number of LCP terminate-request transmissions to <n>
# (default 3).
lcp-max-terminate 3

# Set the maximum number of LCP configure-request transmissions to <n>
# (default 10).
lcp-max-configure 10

# Set the maximum number of LCP configure-NAKs returned before starting
# to send configure-Rejects instead to <n> (default 10).
lcp-max-failure 10

# Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for <n> seconds.
# The link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP packets) are being sent or
# received.  Note: it is not advisable to use this option with the persist
# option without the demand option.  If the active-filter option is given,
# data packets which are rejected by the specified activity filter also
# count as the link being idle.
